# Isometa Challenge: A music artist registry
Provided in this repo is the code base for a coding challenge. Here is the description of the challenge:

You will finish the production of a music artist registry. The functionality for listing artists is already done. You will work with adding genres to the product, and what artist belongs to what genre. We need the following:

* The ability to list genres. The genre list should show the name of the genre and the number of artists that belongs to the genre.
* The ability to add new genres. The genre should be empty when added, with no belonging artists.
* The ability to add an artist to a genre from the edit artist page.

Hints/Notes:
* This system uses code first so there's no need to set up a database on your own.
* Make sure the functionality you add is accessible to ordinary users.
* Keep it simple. There's no need to add extra functionality or design beyond what is asked for.
* Comment your code if you feel that something might be unclear.
* Feel free to point out things you think could be improved in the existing code.
* There is no need to change the underlying model classes for artists and genres
